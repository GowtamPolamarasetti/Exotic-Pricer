As theory predicts, the Gamma should become extremely large and unstable as the asset price approaches the barrier, and then drop to zero once the barrier is breached. This visualization is a powerful qualitative validation of our Finite Difference engine."

    "### 9.2 Discussion of Model Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial part of any quantitative project is to acknowledge its limitations. The primary simplifying assumption made throughout this engine is its reliance on the **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** model. The key limitations of this model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Constant Volatility**: The model assumes the volatility (σ) of the underlying asset is constant. In reality, volatility changes over time and is dependent on the asset's price and the option's strike (a phenomenon known as the \"volatility smile\"). This is the most significant limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **No Jumps**: GBM models continuous asset price movements. It does not account for sudden, discontinuous jumps that can occur in markets due to unexpected news or events.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Lognormal Distribution**: The model implies that asset returns are normally distributed (and prices are log-normally distributed). Empirical evidence shows that real-world returns often exhibit \"fat tails,\" meaning extreme events are more likely than the normal distribution predicts."

    "### 9.3 Roadmap for Future Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "The modular architecture of the engine makes it an excellent platform for future extensions. Potential enhancements to address the limitations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Implementing Advanced Stochastic Processes**: The `models` module could be extended to include more realistic processes:\n",
    "    * **Heston Model**: To capture stochastic (non-constant) volatility.\n",
    "    * **Merton's Jump-Diffusion Model**: To incorporate market shocks and jumps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Supporting Multi-Asset Options**: The engine's architecture could be expanded to price options whose payoffs depend on multiple underlying assets (e.g., basket options, rainbow options). This would primarily involve updating the `MonteCarloEngine` to handle correlated asset price simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Integrating Machine Learning Techniques**: Explore the use of machine learning for tasks such as:\n",
    "    * **Model Calibration**: Using neural networks to quickly calibrate complex models like Heston to the market's implied volatility surface.\n",
    "    * **Fast Pricing Proxies**: Training a model to learn the pricing function, allowing for near-instantaneous pricing once the model is trained."
